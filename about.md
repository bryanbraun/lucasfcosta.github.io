I'm an Information Systems student at [UFSC - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://ufsc.br) and I'm currently working as a development intern at [Hydra Systems (formerly known as Portable Slots)](http://hydrasystems.com.br/).

Currently I am, and I will ever be, in love with open software and the web. If you need any help pushing the web forward you can bet I will be willing work.

If you're interested in any subject I've ever written on this website or even if you just want to talk feel free to contact me on any of the social network profiles below.
